# Itinerary Generator App for GA_project3
- This is a shared repository between Sandy and Songrong for GA_project3


##Goal and purpose
To design an AI-powered web-app that helps tourists plan their travel based on preferences such as travel days, food, and tour sight preferences, with the outcome displayed on Google Maps. 

The goal is to simplify the travel planning process, save time, and enhance the overall travel experience for users.


Research and Ideation: Conduct thorough research to gather insights about your target audience, competitors, and current market trends. Generate ideas and brainstorm potential features and functionalities for your app.

# TimeLine
Stage 1 (Week 1): 

Front-end 

- Wireframe of the web-app
- Homepage and header with the following menu items:
  Home/login 
  Home/Saved trips [for users who are logged in]
- User account creation and login via email

- Trip creation
- Allow users to have multiple saved trips with each containing its own details page containing the itinerary (stretch or week 3)
- Log-in Verification (Front-End) 
  - Email verification for sign-up (stretch goal?)
  - Login via Single Sign-Ons (Stretch goal)
- Edit trip created in case of user input error (stretch goal)

Backend
- Database set-up
- Cluster set-up for the user accounts
- Google API set-up for the location
- Back-end login-details verification
- Streaming to make the response of openAI faster

Stage 2 (Week 2):
Frontend: 
- Results generated by Chatgpt to display as 1 activity/per card
- Option to save activity cards to trip/day
- Option to remove and/or replace activity from trip/day 
- Display activity cards on Google map
- Logout


Stage 3 (Week 3): 
- Buffer week to complete any other tasks
- Mobile view - block and ask the user to use the desktop. If we can finish the tasks on time, we can do media query.

Features to be added: 


_Create User Personas: Develop user personas representing your target audience. User personas help you understand user behavior, preferences, and pain points. This information will guide your design decisions._


_Sketching and Wireframing: Begin the design process by sketching rough ideas on paper or using digital tools. Convert these sketches into wireframes, which are basic visual representations of your app's layout and structure. Wireframes help you establish the app's navigation flow and overall structure._


_Design Mockups: Once the wireframes are finalized, create high-fidelity design mockups using graphic design software. Pay attention to visual aesthetics, typography, color schemes, and brand consistency. Design each screen and define the user interface (UI) elements._


_Prototype Development: Build interactive prototypes to simulate the app's functionality and user interactions. Prototypes allow you to test and validate your design concepts before investing in full development. Use prototyping tools like InVision, Figma, or Adobe XD.
Usability Testing: Conduct usability testing with a small group of target users. Gather feedback on the app's user experience (UX), identify areas of improvement, and make necessary changes to the design based on user insights._
